# High-Level Design (HLD) for Ecommerce Website 

Architecture Components
Load Balancers (LB)
API Gateway
Microservices
Databases (Relational and NoSQL)
Message Broker (Kafka)
Caching (Redis)
Search and Analytics (Elasticsearch)

# 1. Load Balancers (LB)
Function: Distribute incoming user requests across multiple server instances to balance load and ensure high availability.
Tool: Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).

# 2. API Gateway
Function: Entry point for clients. Routes requests to the right microservices, handles rate limiting, and manages authentication.
Tool: Kong.

# 3. Microservices Architecture

## 3.1 User Management Service
Handles user registration, login, profile management, and password reset.
Uses MySQL as the primary database for structured user data.
Uses Kafka to communicate relevant user activities to other services (e.g., a new user registration event can trigger welcome emails or offers).

## 3.2 Product Catalog Service
Manages product listings, details, categorization.
Uses MySQL.
Incorporates Elasticsearch for fast product searches, providing features like full-text search and typo correction.

## 3.3 Cart Service
Manages user's shopping cart.
Uses MongoDB for flexibility in cart structures.
Uses Redis for fast, in-memory data access (e.g., to quickly retrieve a userâ€™s cart).

## 3.4 Order Management Service
Handles order processing, history, and tracking.
Uses MySQL.
Communicates with Payment Service and User Management Service through Kafka for order status updates, payment verifications, etc.

## 3.5 Payment Service
Manages payment gateways and transaction logs.
Uses MySQL.
Once the payment is confirmed, it produces a message on Kafka to notify the Order Management Service.

## 3.6 Notification Service:
Manages email and potentially other notifications (e.g., SMS).
Consumes Kafka messages for events that require user notifications (like registration confirmations, order updates).
Integrates with third-party platforms like Amazon SES for actual email delivery.

# 4. Databases
MySQL: For structured data.
MongoDB: For flexible, unstructured data.

# 5. Kafka
Central message broker allowing asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring data consistency, and acting as an event store for critical actions.

# 6. Caching with Redis
Primarily by Cart Service for faster response times.

# 7. Elasticsearch
Used by Product Catalog for fast and relevant product searches.

# Typical Flow with Kafka & Elasticsearch Integration

Part 1
User logs in and searches for a product.
Request reaches LB, then passed to API Gateway.
API Gateway routes the search request to Product Catalog Service.
Product Catalog Service queries Elasticsearch for a fast product search.

Part 2
User adds a product to the cart.
Cart Service produces a message to Kafka about this action.


Part 3
User checks out, triggering the Order Management Service.
After placing the order, a message is sent to Kafka.
Payment Service consumes the Kafka message to process payment.
